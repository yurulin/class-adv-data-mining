**Communication & Email policy**

We will regularly post announcements on Teams related to schedule changes, assignments, graded quizzes, follow-ups to lectures, INFSCI-2915 and other school or department-related activities.

Instead of email the instructor or TAs individually, please follow the class communication policy:

* *Ask questions publicly*: In general, all questions about coursework, course logistics, etc. should be asked publicly on Teams. If you ask such a question privately, we will not answer it: we will ask you to post your question publicly, and will answer it once you do. This way, everyone can benefit from the answer to the question and, if someone runs into the same issue you do, we can refer them to the answer we provided in your post.
* *Communicate private matters*: If you need to ask a private question, you can send an email to [yuru-class-adm [at] googlegroups [dot] com](yuru-class-adm@googlegroups.com). Your email will be seen only by the instructor and TAs. This should be used only for truly private matters that relate uniquely to you (e.g., you need to notify us of a family/medical emergency, etc.).

# Course Schedule
See the course [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R75v6J2hxWMFaf_JrgM7jkKq5HzLX2uYZtQ_YoU0xm0/edit?usp=sharing) page.

# Computing
This course will use R and/or Python for computing, so fluency in either or both programming languages is required. GitHub will be used for homework and project assignments, where tools such as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) or [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) will be used for creating reproducible data science documents. Examples in lectures or homework assignments will be mainly in R/Python.
